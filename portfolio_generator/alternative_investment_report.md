## Shipping

### Danish Carriers Brace for Rate Normalization Despite Resilience  
A recent survey of Denmark’s leading shipping firms shows that while confidence remains high, most expect freight rates to moderate over the next 12 months as vessel orders come online. Companies plan to pause new green-fuel vessel orders until clearer policy signals emerge.

### Tanker Market Strength Faces Near-Term Headwinds  
May VLCC and Aframax spot rates have climbed, but near-term momentum may wane as OPEC+ output talks accelerate supply and northern summer maintenance draws ships offline. Suezmax rates improved elsewhere, suggesting a mixed picture across oil-trade lanes.

### Dirty Crude Flows to China Slow Amid Sharper Russian Export Declines  
Quarterly data show Chinese dirty crude imports down on weaker Russian flows. Spot VNAGC‐AG route rates briefly firmed but may soften as alternative suppliers fill gaps. Saudi volumes remain stable, offering a reliable offset.

### Ardmore Shipping Shifts Emphasis to Retrofit over Newbuilds  
Ardmore’s newbuild pipeline may slow in favor of retrofits on existing tonnage to meet FuelEU targets. The pivot reflects prudent capex discipline amid uncertain charter-hire premiums for alternative fuels.

## Commodities

### Oil Poised for Choppy Summer on OPEC+ Supply Options  
Brent and WTI slipped after Bloomberg reported possible 411,000 bpd July output hikes. Inventories in the U.S. saw surprise draws, but summer driving season demand will determine near-term price support.

### Metals Markets Rebalance as China Demand Eases  
At LME’s Hong Kong forum, traders noted lighter Chinese buying but remain constructive on copper and nickel over 6–12 months as EV and grid-build activity rebounds outside of China.

### EU Fertilizer Tariffs May Spur Domestic Capex but Raise Food Costs  
The EU’s vote to push Russian/Belarus nitrates duties near 100% will encourage Western green-ammonia investment yet risk raising farmer input bills and food inflation.

## Central Bank Policies

### Egypt’s Cautious Monetary Easing  
A 100 bp rate cut in May (deposit rate to 24%) underlines Policy Committee caution as growth hits 5.0% and inflation moderates from 14.0%. Ahead, fiscal consolidation may slow disinflation, keeping future easing measured.

### Egypt’s Summer Rate-Cut Window—Fact or Hype?  
Bloomberg suggests one more cut before reforms prompt caution. However, rising core services inflation and fiscal uncertainty argue for a more conservative pause after May’s cut.

### ECB’s “Pause vs. Pivot” Debate Intensifies  
While a June cut is widely priced, real-economy resilience and shifting inflation expectations may tilt July toward a hold. Trade barriers and fiscal spending risks support keeping the easing bias intact.

### ECB Minutes Stress “Stability Beacon” over Haste

### Corporate Cash Hoards to Reverse on Re-Industrialization

### European Stocks under Pressure from Yield Rises and Tariff Fallout

## Global Trade & Tariffs

### Walmart vs. Target—Margins vs. Market Share  
Tariff costs force Walmart to hike prices; Target opts to absorb costs, losing margin but defending traffic. We believe Target’s brand loyalty and omnichannel mix may offer better medium-term upside despite short-term margin headwinds.

# Executive Summary – Allocation

We tilt away from tanker shorts (STNG) to target dry bulk (BDRY) and containers (ZIM), reduce mineral cyclicals (RIO/VALE) modestly, and introduce a gold hedge (GLD). Energy weights are eased in favor of broader “real-asset” themes (dry bulk, renewables). SPY remains a core ballast.  

**Differing Views:**
- **STNG (Short):** We initiate a 5% short in Scorpio Tankers, contrasting the base report’s long. Rising VLCC supply and OPEC+ output hikes risk rate softening in Q3.  
- **BDRY (Long):** We increase dry-bulk ETF exposure to 10%, versus 6% previously, capitalizing on mid-cycle rate recovery as steel fundamentals improve post-tariff adjustments.  
- **GLD (Long):** A new 5% position in gold (GLD) provides a hedge against fiscal and tariff-driven volatility, diverging from the prior removal of precious-metal plays.  

# Executive Summary – Insights

- **Scorpio Tankers (STNG) – Short 5%**  
  We expect spot MR and LR2 rates to soften as newbuild deliveries peak in late Q3 and OPEC+ boosts oil flows. Orasis’s shipping-cycle model signals a distribution-phase in tanker earnings, warranting a tactical short.  
- **Breakwave Dry Bulk ETF (BDRY) – Long 10%**  
  Dry bulk flows from steel restocking and tariff-driven sourcing shifts support a rebound in BDI fundamentals. Orasis’s freight-flow monitoring indicates tightening ton-mile demand post-US tariffication, favoring BDRY.  
- **Gold ETF (GLD) – Long 5%**  
  Elevated U.S. deficits ($36.2 trn + $3.8 trn from tax bill), high bond yields, and tail risks (China-Taiwan) underpin gold’s safe-haven role. GLD complements our real-asset focus, hedging cross-asset shocks.

# Portfolio Positioning & Expected Drivers  
This alternative portfolio is constructed to exploit the trade-flow shifts in bulk shipping and container lines, while providing a buffer against macro-political turbulence through a gold allocation. We trim pure tanker and commodity miners in favor of dry bulk and trade-dense container yards.  

# Market Outlook  
Global growth remains uneven, with tariff frictions creating cyclical distortions in shipping and commodity flows. Central banks are straddling sticky services inflation and headwinds from trade barriers. In this context, real-assets with direct trade-flow sensitivity and limited leverage—dry bulk and containers—offer asymmetric upside.  

# Portfolio Strategy & Positioning Rationale  
We adapt Orasis’s multi-asset framework by rotating into segments at inflection points: dry bulk demand rebound amid steel-maker destocking cycles, container recovery from pent-up consumer shipments, and a gold hedge to manage tail-risk. Broad equity (SPY) provides core beta, while modest energy and renewables (NEE) capture structural energy transition.
