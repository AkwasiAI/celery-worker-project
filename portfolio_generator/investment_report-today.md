### Baltic Index Dips on Weaker Capesize Demand

The Baltic Exchange’s dry bulk freight index fell 7 points to 1,340, driven by a 1% drop in Capesize vessel earnings to $15,454/day. Investors should note potential margin pressure for owners of large bulk carriers and consider underweight positions in shipping equities if weaker iron-ore volumes persist.

### Container Shipping Poised to Gain from US-China Tariff Truce

A 90-day reciprocal tariff reduction between the U.S. and China should boost transpacific volumes, reducing blank sailings and supporting spot rates. Short-term chartering activity in the containership sector is likely to surge, presenting a tactical buying opportunity in select liner stocks ahead of renewed trade flows.

## Commodities

### Rising global oil stocks signal price pressure

- Inventories of crude and products onshore surged by over 100 million barrels-the highest since early 2020-while floating storage rose 14% to 160 million barrels. This oversupply trend threatens oil prices, suggesting energy investors may need to hedge upstream exposure and consider underweight positions in oil-service and exploration equities.

### U.S. crude and product inventories likely drew 1.4 million barrels

- A Reuters poll forecasts U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 1.4 million barrels last week, with distillate and gasoline inventories also down. The anticipated draw supports near-term oil price strength, offering a tactical buying opportunity in crude futures or energy-sector stocks poised to benefit from tighter supply.

### U.S. corn export sales hit a three-year high pace for 2025-26

- As of May 8, U.S. corn bookings for the 2025-26 marketing year reached 2.75 million t-a three-year high-driven by robust global demand despite rising Brazilian competition. Strong forward sales underpin bullish grain price outlooks, presenting opportunities in agricultural commodity funds and agribusiness equities.

### Critical minerals market concentration heightens supply risk

- An IEA report warns refining and processing of key energy-transition minerals remain highly concentrated-top-three suppliers to hold 82% of output by 2035-heightening the risk of supply shocks. Investors should assess concentration risk across battery-metal miners and explore diversified exposure to mitigate potential disruptions.

### Copper dips as tariff uncertainty clouds demand outlook

- LME copper eased 0.1% to $9,519/ton amid fears U.S. tariff probes may dampen demand, offsetting support from a softer dollar and Chinese rate cuts. Traders might consider short-term hedges or tactical underweights in base-metals holdings given potential volatility from evolving trade policies.

## Central Bank Policies

### What If the June ECB Cut Is the Last One?

Citi analysts, echoing ECB’s Isabel Schnabel, warn that after the deposit rate falls to 2% in June, the ECB may pause further easing amid trade-tariff headwinds. Money markets now price just two more 25bp cuts this year and see rates on hold until mid-2026, impacting euro-area bond yields and bank funding costs.
- citation: https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/what-if-the-june-ecb-cut-is-the-last-one/

### Fed Officials Expect Tariffs to Boost Prices; Rate Cuts Delayed

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic says pre-tariff inventory front-loading is ending, so inflationary effects from U.S. import duties will soon hit prices. He now anticipates only one 25bp rate cut this year, pushing out Fed easing. Investors should brace for a longer period of higher short-term rates and plan bond and duration strategies accordingly.

### China Cuts Key Lending Rates to 3% and 3.5%

The People’s Bank of China trimmed its one-year LPR by 10bp to 3.00% and its five-year LPR by 10bp to 3.50%, the lowest since 2019, while major state banks cut deposit rates. This modest easing aims to support credit growth and consumption amid trade-war uncertainty. Investors may pivot toward Chinese financials and property developers as funding costs fall.

### ECB’s Escriva Sees U.S. Tariffs Threatening Financial Stability

ECB policymaker José Luis Escriva warns that “reciprocal” U.S. tariffs, if implemented, would push Spain’s average export duty to 18% and undermine global growth. He highlights indirect shocks via supply chains and confidence channels, flagging risks to euro-area credit markets. Fixed-income investors should monitor peripheral spreads and geopolitical policy shifts.
- citation: https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ecbs-escriva-sees-risks-global-financial-sector-us-trade-policies-2025-05-20/

### Schnabel Warns Tariffs Could Rekindle Euro-Zone Inflation

ECB board member Isabel Schnabel cautions that, after an initial dip below 2%, U.S. tariffs may stoke inflation further out by prompting firms to raise prices broadly, not just on tariffed goods. This risk supports a hawkish tilt in ECB messaging. Equity and bond markets should price in the potential for higher future short-term rates.

## Macroeconomic News

### Japan’s Export Growth Slows as US Tariffs Bite

- Japan’s total exports rose just 2% in April, down from 4% in March, while shipments to the US fell 1.8% year-on-year. Automobiles and steel led the decline as tariffs took effect. Investors may underweight Japan-focused export stocks and hedge yen exposure, monitoring trade-talk outcomes and BOJ policy shifts.

### US Tariffs Damp Global Exporters’ Outlook

- A survey of 4,500 exporters found 42% expect a marked drop in export revenues after new US tariffs, versus just 5% prior. Uncertainty and fragmentation hit trade confidence, signalling risks for global cyclicals and credit markets. Investors should reassess exposure to trade-sensitive sectors and stress-test supply-chain risk.

### South Korea Pledges Support for Export Industries under US Tariffs

- Seoul announced targeted support for biopharmaceutical and automotive exporters facing US duties, with further measures for semiconductors and steel. Enhanced incentives may cushion margins and preserve market share. Investors could favour Korean exporters with state backing, while monitoring potential fiscal strain from subsidy programmes.

### Indian Rupee’s Inert Reaction to Dollar Decline Puzzles Bankers

- Despite a weaker dollar, the Indian rupee traded near 85.6 per USD in May, underperforming regional peers due to portfolio outflows and tariff-talk uncertainties. Investors should review FX hedging strategies, monitor RBI interventions and gauge the impact of Indo-US trade negotiations on capital flows.

### US Importers Rush to Bonded Warehouses amid Tariff Volatility

- US firms racing to convert warehouses into tariff-exempt bonded facilities reflect 30% duties on Chinese imports. Bonded space now costs four times standard warehousing, straining logistics and working capital. Warehouse REITs and logistics providers could see gains, but policy reversals pose execution and capacity risks.

## Global Trade & Tariffs

### Global retailers’ tariff strategy risks spreading pain beyond U.S. consumer

Major global brands like Birkenstock and Pandora are considering small price hikes across all markets-rather than steep increases in the U.S.-to absorb new 10% U.S. import duties. This “tariff-shifting” tactic could export inflation to Europe and the UK, pressuring consumer staples margins and prompting central banks to monitor second-round price effects.
- citation: https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/global-retailers-tariff-strategy-risks-spreading-pain-beyond-us-consumer-2025-05-20/

### U.S. importers rush to convert warehouses into tariff-free zones

Faced with 30% duties on Chinese goods, U.S. companies are scrambling to certify bonded warehouses, deferring tariff payments until goods are sold. Bonded-warehouse rents have quadrupled, spotlighting warehouse REITs and logistics providers. However, if U.S. trade policy shifts again, these facilities risk overcapacity and abrupt margin pressure.

### U.S. tariffs dampen mood of global exporters, study shows

A survey of 4,500 exporters across nine markets finds 42% now expect a marked drop in export revenues following April’s new U.S. duties, up from just 5% before. Heightened uncertainty and fragmented trade outlooks signal increased credit risk for cyclical exporters and underscore the need for portfolio stress-testing in trade-sensitive sectors.

### U.S. trade panel paves way for stiff tariffs on many solar imports

The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled that cheap modules from Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam harm domestic producers, clearing the path for countervailing and anti-dumping duties. Higher solar-panel costs could delay project economics, but may benefit U.S. manufacturers like First Solar and Hanwha Qcells listed in clean-energy supply chains.

### Fed officials expect tariffs to boost prices; rate cuts delayed

Atlanta Fed’s Raphael Bostic warns that pre-tariff stockpiling is ending and import duties will soon filter through to consumer prices. With inflationary pressure set to rise, the Fed now foresees only one rate cut this year, pushing out easing. Fixed-income investors should brace for extended higher rates and reassess duration strategies.

## Geopolitical Events

### Israel Expands Military Operation in Gaza

Israeli Defence Minister Gallant announced a major expansion of military operations in Gaza, seizing significant territory and ordering large-scale civilian evacuations. Heightened regional conflict risks fuel oil price volatility, boost defence-sector equities and safe-haven assets. Insurers may hike war-risk premiums on Red Sea and Mediterranean shipping lanes.

### Vietnam Trade Minister Meets Lockheed Martin and SpaceX amid U.S. Tariff Talks

Vietnam’s Trade Minister Nguyen Hong Dien held discussions in Washington with executives from Lockheed Martin, SpaceX and Google, aiming to showcase Vietnam’s strategic partnership and seek tariff exemptions ahead of a threatened 46% levy. Progress may attract foreign direct investment in defence, satellite and energy sectors, and reduce supply-chain costs for Vietnamese exporters.

### U.S. Trade Panel Paves Way for Steep Tariffs on Solar Imports

The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled that solar module imports from Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam were dumped and unfairly subsidised, clearing the path for countervailing and anti-dumping duties. Higher panel costs could delay renewable-energy project returns but stand to benefit domestic manufacturers like First Solar and Hanwha Qcells.

### ECB’s Escriva Sees U.S. Tariffs Threatening Global Financial Stability

ECB policymaker José Luis Escriva warned that reciprocal U.S. tariffs would raise Spain’s average export duty from 12% to 18%, undermining growth and confidence via supply-chain and financial channels. Investors should monitor widening credit spreads in euro-area peripherals and reassess risk premia in corporate and sovereign debt amid policy unpredictability.

### South Korea Pledges Support for Tariff-Hit Export Industries

Seoul announced targeted aid for biopharmaceutical and automotive exporters facing U.S. tariffs, including tax credits and low-cost financing, to preserve margins and market share. While support may bolster leading Korean export names, investors should watch for potential fiscal strain and the impact on sovereign credit metrics if measures expand.

## Executive Summary - Allocation

In the current allocation, we added Chevron (CVX) at 8%, trimmed integrated energy (XOM, SHEL) and core shipping names (STNG, FRO) by 2-4%, removed Wheaton (WPM) and the Glencore short, and boosted SPY to 23%. These shifts concentrate on energy upside, shipping-led trade signals, and macro hedging, in line with Orasis’s principles.

## Executive Summary - Insights

- Chevron Corp (CVX) adds US integrated energy leverage, capturing robust cash flows from OPEC+ supply discipline and geopolitical risk premiums. This new position aligns with Orasis’s balanced cyclicals and macro-opportunistic themes, hedging commodity betas while benefiting from disciplined capex, free cash generation, and secular demand supported by global trade flows.
- Precious-metals streaming WPM is removed to reallocate defensive capital into core energy and broad-market positions, reflecting Orasis’s barbell approach. As freight-driven trade-flow dislocations soften and geopolitical premiums normalize, gold streaming offers diminished alpha. We prefer direct exposure to shipping-compound indicators and energy cyclicals for data-driven macro hedging and liquidity hedges.
- Glencore short GLNCY is exited, as margin normalization in commodity trading is underway amid lower volatility. Orasis’s risk-balanced hedging now shifts toward direct macro instruments. This streamlines portfolio focus on shipping and energy alpha sources, where trade-flow indicators provide clearer predictive signals, avoiding intermediary trading-house exposure for tactical short use.

**Executive summary - Comprehensive Portfolio**

2025-05-21

**Portfolio Positioning & Expected Drivers:**

The portfolio is positioned for resilient total returns by overweighting energy and shipping names set to benefit from tight supply dynamics and elevated freight rates. Key drivers include sustained geopolitical risk premiums in oil markets, disciplined vessel supply supporting charter rates, and structural demand for base metals amid global infrastructure investment. A core broad-market ETF and selective commodity miners provide diversification and volatility mitigation.

**Market Outlook:**

We anticipate inflation to moderate gradually while central banks maintain restrictive policy, favoring cash-generative companies in energy and selective materials. Oil prices should remain supported by OPEC+ discipline and geopolitical frictions. Shipping rates across tankers and dry bulk are expected to stay firm due to limited newbuild deliveries and resilient trade volumes, whereas broad equity markets may trade sideways with episodic volatility.

**Portfolio Strategy & Positioning Rationale:**

Leveraging Orasis’ trade-flow analysis, we overweight large-cap energy (XOM, CVX, SHEL) and offshore services (TDW) to capture margin expansion. We hold high-conviction tanker operators (STNG, FRO) and dry bulk carriers (GOGL, SBLK) to benefit from tight vessel supply. Commodities exposure (RIO, VALE, ALB) targets secular demand trends, while SPY anchors the portfolio with low-beta market coverage. This mix aims to deliver asymmetric upside in our favored sectors while managing downside risk through diversification.
