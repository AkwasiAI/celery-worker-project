### Search Results for "latest shipping rates"

#### Source 1: Maritime Industry Report (2025-04-29)
Tanker shipping rates reached a 5-year high in April 2025, with VLCC rates averaging $75,000/day on key routes. Analysts attribute this to increased ton-mile demand due to geopolitical tensions and longer trade routes.

#### Source 2: Bloomberg (2025-04-28) 
Dry bulk shipping rates have seen moderate recovery, with the Baltic Dry Index reaching 2,450 points, up 15% from last month. Chinese steel production and Australian iron ore exports are cited as key drivers.

#### Source 3: Financial Times (2025-04-30)
Container shipping rates on Asia-Europe routes showed stability at $3,500/TEU, while transpacific routes experienced a 7% increase to $4,200/TEU, according to Xeneta data. Carriers are successfully managing capacity ahead of peak season.

### Search Results for "energy market outlook 2025"

#### Source 1: IEA Monthly Report (2025-04-15)
The International Energy Agency projects Brent crude oil prices to average $82-88/barrel for the remainder of 2025, with potential upside risk from OPEC+ production discipline and Middle East tensions.

#### Source 2: Energy Intelligence Group (2025-04-22)
Natural gas prices are expected to remain elevated in Europe at â‚¬35-40/MWh due to continued competition with Asian buyers for LNG cargoes. US natgas prices forecasted at $3.50-4.00/MMBtu.

#### Source 3: Goldman Sachs Research (2025-04-25)
Energy transition spending is projected to reach $1.8 trillion in 2025, with particular growth in battery storage, hydrogen infrastructure, and grid expansion projects.
