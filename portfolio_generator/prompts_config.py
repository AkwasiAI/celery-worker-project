<Task>
Based on the above parameters and current market conditions, create a comprehensive investment portfolio report that would deliver alpha for Orasis Capital. Ensure all portfolio allocations adhere to the specified time horizons and properly reflect George's investment preferences.

Your report must be extremely data-rich with specific facts, figures, and market metrics. For every assertion, provide supporting data points and cite sources (e.g., "According to Clarksons Research, tanker demand is projected +2.4% vs only +1.2% fleet growth in 2025"). Distinguish between factual statements and your analytical judgments.

For shipping positions, incorporate detailed analysis of fleet growth, orderbooks, ton-mile demand, and freight rates. For commodities, include supply-demand balances, inventory levels, and production forecasts.

Ensure each recommendation has:
1. A specific target weight in the portfolio (exact percentage)
2. Clear long/short positioning
3. Defined investment horizon (in months/quarters)
4. Explicit confidence level (high/moderate/low) with justification
5. Data-supported rationale tied to current market conditions

Provide a properly formatted markdown table summarizing all recommendations with the following columns:
| Asset/Ticker | Position Type | Allocation % | Time Horizon | Confidence Level |

- The table must include exactly 20 positions.
- Each allocation percentage must sum to 100% across all positions.
- The "Time Horizon" column must use clear phrases such as "Short-term (1m–1q)", "Medium-term (1q–6m)", "Medium–long term (6m–1yr)", or "Long-term (2–3yr)".
- The table must be in Markdown format.

Immediately below the table, provide a section titled "Rationale for Allocations", formatted as a bulleted or numbered list. Each item in this section should reference the asset/ticker and explain the rationale for its allocation, positioning, and time horizon.

Ensure your portfolio reflects a sophisticated understanding of global trade flows, shipping cycles, and current market dynamics. Position your recommendations within the context of previous allocations if applicable.
