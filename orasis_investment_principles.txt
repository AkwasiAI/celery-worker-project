Orasis Capital Investment Principles
====================================

Summary of investment philosophy and process (from George, Orasis Capital):

- Capitalize on global trade opportunities, especially where new policies, geopolitical events, technological innovation, and environmental issues create investment opportunities.
- Identify shifts in global trade relationships and analyze their impact on countries, industries, and companies.
- Focus on changes in tariffs and sanctions, and their effects.
- Monitor the changing weight of countries in global trade, with a focus on China, Asia, Middle East, and Africa.
- Analyze structural shifts in global trade and carry out macro-analysis across countries, companies, and commodities.
- Select investment themes based on global trade patterns, then select asset classes (shipping equities/credit, commodities, ETFs, equity indices, fixed income) for implementation.
- Research approach starts with shipping (90% of global trade by volume) as a leading macro indicator.
- Analyze shipping market data, asset values, contracts, and cargo flows to generate alpha and macro-level investment ideas.
- Analytical edge comes from early data, monitoring sub-sectors and commodity flows, and understanding market responses to policy changes.
- Time investments based on shipping cycles and business cycles, with a focus on sector rotation and risk management.
- Major investment themes are driven by geopolitical developments, with a preference for countries/companies neutral to conflict and those in Asia-Pacific.
- Portfolio management emphasizes diversification (5-25 themes/positions), liquidity (50% liquidatable in 5 days), correlation and risk analysis, and dynamic allocation across sectors and asset classes.
- Active monitoring, regular reviews, disciplined exits, and an experienced team are key to execution.
