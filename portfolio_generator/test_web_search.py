        Orasis Capital Multi-Asset Portfolio â€“ April 29, 2025
        
        The current global economic landscape presents a complex mix of challenges and opportunities for investors. While traditional markets in the US and Europe continue to show signs of slowing growth and monetary tightening, emerging economies in Asia and Africa are demonstrating resilience and increased trade activity. This divergence creates significant opportunities for targeted investments in shipping, commodities, and trade-focused assets.
        
        Our portfolio strategy emphasizes positioning in high-quality shipping assets, particularly in the tanker and LNG segments, where supply constraints and ton-mile expansion create favorable conditions. We also maintain selective exposure to commodity producers benefiting from renewed Asian demand, while maintaining tactical hedges against overvalued regions and sectors facing structural headwinds.
